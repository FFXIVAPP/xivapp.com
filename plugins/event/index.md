The event plugin is highly tuned to provide a customized experience and notification system based on chat line events from the game.

It allows the user to make events that can use TTS, program execution and sound files.

## Home

This is the main area of the Event plugin.

Every event is saved as a Regular Expression. It currently offers options such as:

* Category for grouping in the list.
* How long you want to wait before performing the event after it’s matched something.
* Expression match.
* Sound file.
* Volume percent.
* TTS if you wish to have a spoken sound.
* Speech rate.
* Executable options such as running another program with command line arguments.

The buttons at the bottom are:

* Refresh sounds list.
* Remove selected event.
* Add a new event or update one that is already selected.

When you select an event you can modify the different options for that even and update it.
