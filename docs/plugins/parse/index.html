<p><img src="/images/logos/parse.png" alt="" class="image-left image-box image-128" />
This is among one of the most used parsers for Final Fantasy XIV and was for quite some time the only one actively being developed.</p>

<p>It provides real-time data, is open source and presented in a way that is usable and friendly. It‚Äôs been used since Beta of 1.0 and is always evolving.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

<ul>
  <li>FFXIV-APP</li>
  <li>NET 4.6.2</li>
  <li>The ‚ÄúBattle‚Äù tab in-game or at least one tab by itself must have every chat line turned on for battle</li>
  <li>For proper parsing of yourself you must at least set your first/last name of character</li>
  <li>Server is used to pull in your lodestone avatar pictures</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="usage--features">Usage &amp; Features</h1>

<h2 id="home--basic-view">Home ‚ûú Basic View</h2>

<p>When using default settings this is the basic view shown to all users. The score card for the party has some basic breakdowns.</p>

<p>Whenever you see the term ‚ÄúCombined‚Äù or ‚ÄúComb.‚Äù what that means is it includes XOverTime spells like healing/damage/etc.</p>

<p>These are all tracked independently of each other as you will see in further screenshots.</p>

<p>Each player has his or her own score card as well. While not shown in this screen shot when playing while the game is running a job icon will be displayed next to the persons picture.</p>

<p>The title bar of each card displays the total overall DPS along with how active the person was during the fight.</p>

<p>Below that you will have identifiers [YOU] for you, [P] for party member, [A] or alliance and [O] for other. This is also dependant on whether you are parsing the alliance/others.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind parsing others is resource intensive but can be done. It will include anyone around you and just to the edge of your visible range.</p>

<p>At the bottom there is an options to load an existing file and currently has limitations that anything status based will not be re-parsed. This functionality will be readjusted to use a exported parse from the program.</p>

<p>You can also choose the advanced view or reset the currently parse manually to start fresh.</p>

<p>If enabled when reseting the parser it will store a copy of that in memory until you shut it down. This allows you to go back and have a look after the fact.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/basic-view.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="home--advanced-view">Home ‚ûú Advanced View</h2>

<p>If enabled now have an advanced view.</p>

<p>View source is current and past parses (if enabled for history storing).</p>

<p>View type can be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Score Cards (as shown)</li>
  <li>Party</li>
  <li>Party (ALL)</li>
  <li>Monster</li>
  <li>Monster (ALL)</li>
</ul>

<p>What do these mean?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Score Cards
    <ul>
      <li>A continuation of the basic view with no other changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Party
    <ul>
      <li>Overall totals for all players and pets but broken down into subcategories, by action and target.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Party (ALL)
    <ul>
      <li>Overall totals for all players and pets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Monster
    <ul>
      <li>Overall totals for all monsters but broken down into subcategories, by action and target.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Monster (ALL)
    <ul>
      <li>Overall totals for all monsters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will see an example of the break downs (for players) in the following screen shots. There are a few symbols that you will see as part of the action name when viewing. These are there as ‚Äúkeys‚Äù so they are tracked properly.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[‚Ä¢] is XOverTime (healing, damage, etc)</li>
  <li>[‚àû] is over healing.</li>
  <li>[‚Ä¢][‚àû] XOverTime that also over healed.</li>
  <li>[‚òØ] mitigation spells like stoneskin.</li>
  <li>[+] this is an extra or unknown attack which typically comes from Sword Oath (PLD).</li>
</ul>

<p>The upcoming break down of functionality will be the same for monsters as well.</p>

<p>First and foremost because of the way databinding works in the application if you click on someone in the list before they actually have data for something (like a certain action, healing data, etc) to ensure you have the latest data select the player and press refresh. This button is not needed however after they have 1 update to that action because it will bind correctly going forward.</p>

<p>When you select a player it will populate the tabs of data on the right hand side.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/advanced-view.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="home--damage-actions">Home ‚ûú Damage (Actions)</h2>

<p>This tab is broken down into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Totals Normal
    <ul>
      <li>This is a list of actions by the selected player that have been done but do not include damage over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Totals Over Time
    <ul>
      <li>All damage done that is DoT based.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By default in ALL tabs each column is displayed with nothing turned off. You can however through settings or by right clicking anywhere in the list view turn off a column.</p>

<p>Please be advised turning off a column in one tab turns it off in another. If it wasn‚Äôt done this way currently it would bloat the settings page to nearly 2000 items that can be checked.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm open to pull requests to facilitate this better though üôÇ</p>

  <li>DPS, damage per second.</li>
  <li>DTPS, damage taken per second.</li>
  <li>HPS, healing per second.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also can adjust the widget opacity, disable titles on the widgets and enable click-though so it doesn‚Äôt cause a loss of focus on the game.</p>

<p>You can use reset settings to bring back the widget to your main screen (in the case a second screen was disconnected) or open it again if you accidentally or purposefully closed it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/settings-main.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="settings--parseable">Settings ‚ûú Parseable</h2>

<p>The settings on this tab allow you to turn on parsing of you, your party, the alliance or everyone around you. Please be sure to have a chat tab in the game that has all corresponding events turned on as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/settings-parseable.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="settings--colors">Settings ‚ûú Colors</h2>

<p>Default colors for the progress bar background along with named colors for jobs. The default color is specified as ARGB (alpha, red, green, blue) written in hex; while job colors use the following specification:</p>

<h2 id="settings--column-display-settings">Settings ‚ûú Column Display Settings</h2>

<p>This page‚Ä¶ üò•</p>

<p>This tab is another way to turn off the columns in the tabs and really I should just delete it but you will find a couple hundred check boxes in here.</p>

<p>They are broke down into category however.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/settings-column.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="settings--basic-display-settings">Settings ‚ûú Basic Display Settings</h2>

<p>Every ‚ÄúCard‚Äù in basic and advanced has line item on it along with a number. Every stat you see is also available to be displayed on the cards.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a lot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/settings-basic.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="settings--basic-combined-display-settings">Settings ‚ûú Basic Combined Display Settings</h2>

<p>This is an extension of the previous tab but focus on showing combined damage totals vs just regular ones.</p>

<p>With the previous tab you could show both the XOverTime and Regular, etc. This would show those and combined at the same time or any combination therein.</p>

<p><img src="/images/plugins/parse/settings-basic-combined.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="settings--other-options">Settings ‚ûú Other Options</h2>

<p>This is the history and auto reset section. It‚Äôs broken down into the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Track XPS From Parse Start
    <ul>
      <li>From the first moment an event happens, track the over time objects with that date time. This will be depending on what you have selected on the even trigger below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ignore Limit Break Damage
    <ul>
      <li>If on ignores damage based on limit break names.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enable Store History Auto-Reset
    <ul>
      <li>Based on the interval and trigger below, automatically reset the parse and add it to the history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Automatically Load the Last Parse From History on Each Reset
    <ul>
      <li>Deprecated and will be removed as you now select the history item yourself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Store History Interval
    <ul>
      <li>How long to wait after the event trigger to reset the parser.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Store History Event Trigger
    <ul>
      <li>Any or Damage Only.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose Any it means anything and everything from a potion to sprint will trigger the start of the encounter.</p>

<p>If you choose Damage Only than only a damage action (from or to) will trigger the start of the parse.</p>

<p>When the first event is found the parser will auto-reset it self.</p>
